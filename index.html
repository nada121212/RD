        <h2>History of Dakar Rally</h2>
        <p>The Dakar Rally is one of the most challenging off-road races in the world. Originally conceived in 1978 by Thierry Sabine, the race took its name from the capital of Senegal, Dakar, as the original route was from Paris to Dakar. Over the years, the race has moved to different countries, and since 2009, it has been held in South America, and recently, it moved to Saudi Arabia in 2020. The race is famous for its grueling desert stages and extreme conditions, pushing both drivers and vehicles to their limits.</p>
